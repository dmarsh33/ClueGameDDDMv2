For our door direction test:
The Officer's Quarters has a door that opens RIGHT.
The Main Deck has a door that opens DOWN.
The Greenhouse has a door that opens LEFT.
The Crew's Quarters has a door that opens UP.

For our number of doorways test, we have 13 doorways
in our layout. We tested to see if our map contains 13 doors.

For test rooms and room initials we picked rooms that were far away from
eachother so we could test both reading in the legend and ensuring that the
board was generated properly. For example, Main Deck and the Engine Room 
were both tested and were on opposite ends of the board.
